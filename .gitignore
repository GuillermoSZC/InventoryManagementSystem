# Entity Framework Core migrations
# Exclude the migrations snapshot file, as it's often re-generated
# You might want to include the migration files themselves (*.cs)
# but the snapshot file is usually derived from the code.
# If you want to include migration .cs files, you would remove
# the "**/Migrations/*.cs" line if it were present.
# The default snapshot is usually named <ProjectName>ModelSnapshot.cs
**/Migrations/*ModelSnapshot.cs
# Optionally, if you generate other EF Core related files you don't want to track
# efpt.config.json # If you use EF Core Power Tools and don't want to track its config

# SQL Server Express / SQLite files
# Explicitly ignore common database files if they are generated in the project root
# For SQL Server Express, the .mdf and .ldf files are typically outside the project,
# but if you attach them or store them in the project, ignore them.
# For SQLite, the .db file itself should usually be ignored as it's a generated artifact.
